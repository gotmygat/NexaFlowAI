# Animation Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the hero section with sophisticated background animations and a typewriter effect for dynamic text rotation.

## New Features

### 1. Diagonal Animated Background
- **Pattern**: Animated diagonal lines that move continuously across the background
- **Implementation**: CSS-based diagonal gradient pattern with 20-second animation loop
- **Effect**: Creates depth and movement without being distracting
- **Performance**: Pure CSS animation, GPU-accelerated

### 2. Enhanced Gradient Orbs
- **Count**: 3 animated gradient orbs (up from 2)
- **Animation**: Complex movement pattern using `gradient-shift` keyframes
- **Behavior**: Each orb moves, scales, and fades independently
- **Timing**: Staggered delays (0s, 5s, 10s) for natural, flowing motion
- **Colors**: Primary blue, accent green, and primary overlay

### 3. Typewriter Effect
- **Component**: `TypewriterText` - Reusable React component
- **Words Rotation**:
  - "Limitless Profit"
  - "Maximum Returns"
  - "Infinite Gains"
  - "Unlimited Revenue"
- **Behavior**:
  - Types out each word character by character
  - Pauses for 2 seconds when complete
  - Deletes character by character
  - Cycles to next word
  - Infinite loop
- **Visual**: Includes blinking cursor (`|`) for authentic typewriter feel
- **Color**: Gradient from primary to accent color
- **Speed**:
  - Typing: 100ms per character
  - Deleting: 50ms per character
  - Pause: 2000ms

### 4. Headline Structure
**Format**: "Unlock [TYPEWRITER] Potential"

- Static text: "Unlock" and "Potential" in foreground color
- Dynamic text: Typewriter effect in gradient color
- Min-width set to prevent layout shift during text changes

## Technical Details

### CSS Animations

**Diagonal Lines**:
```css
.diagonal-lines {
  background-image: Multiple diagonal gradients;
  animation: diagonal-move 20s linear infinite;
}
```

**Gradient Shift**:
```css
@keyframes gradient-shift {
  - Opacity changes: 0.5 → 0.8 → 0.6 → 0.7 → 0.5
  - Position shifts in X/Y directions
  - Scale transforms: 1.0 → 1.1 → 0.9 → 1.05 → 1.0
}
```

### React Component

**TypewriterText**:
- Uses `useState` for text state management
- `useEffect` with timers for animation logic
- Props: `words[]` array and optional `className`
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Smooth transitions between states

## Performance

- ✅ **GPU Accelerated**: Uses transform and opacity (not layout properties)
- ✅ **No Layout Shifts**: Fixed min-width prevents reflow
- ✅ **Lightweight**: Pure CSS for background, minimal JS for typewriter
- ✅ **Smooth**: 60fps animations on modern devices
- ✅ **Accessible**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` via existing styles

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- All modern mobile browsers

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- [ ] Multiple typewriter lines
- [ ] Custom typing speeds per word
- [ ] Sound effects (optional)
- [ ] Gradient animation on typewriter text
- [ ] Different cursor styles
